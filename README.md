# Employee-Attendance-Remote-Work-Metrics-Dashboard
I am excited to share my recent project, a comprehensive dashboard analyzing employee attendance, sick leave percentages, and work-from-home preferences. This project leverages data visualization to provide valuable insights for managing workforce productivity and health.

 Key Metrics and Insights:
1. **Working Preferences**: 
   - Analyzing whether employees prefer working from home or the office.
   - Understanding the reasons behind choosing to work from home, especially on Mondays and Fridays, at the beginning or end of the month.
   
2. **Attendance Trends**:
   - Identifying patterns in employee attendance to plan team-building activities effectively.
   - Optimizing resource allocation by understanding attendance fluctuations, reducing costs by managing the number of in-office resources.

3. **Sick Leave Analysis**:
   - Monitoring the percentage of sick leave and understanding the reasons behind it.
   - Identifying potential issues within the company if there's a spike in sick leaves, such as insufficient health precautions.

4. **Seasonal Health Precautions**:
   - Proactively planning for seasonal illnesses by offering flu shots before the flu season starts, ensuring a healthier workforce.

5. **Data Transformation and Management**:
   - Combining and transforming multiple data sheets to maintain consistency and accuracy.
   - Creating dynamic measures to calculate total working days, present days, and work-from-home days.

     Visualizations:
- **Area Charts**: Displaying trends in attendance %, sick leave %, and work-from-home % over time.
- **Tables**:
  1. **Employee Summary**: Showing Employee ID, Attendance %, Present Days, and Work-from-Home %.
  2. **Detailed Attendance**: Tracking daily attendance and absence from April 1st to April 29th, including reasons for absence.

     Lessons Learned:
- Efficient data management and dynamic calculations.
- Error handling for date columns to ensure data accuracy.
- User-friendly interface with slicers and filters for easy navigation.
- Proactive health measures by analyzing sick leave patterns.

This project has provided valuable insights into employee attendance and remote work patterns. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further details about the project!
